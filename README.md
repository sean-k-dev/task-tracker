# Task Tracker
My Task Tracker is a React-based web application which allows you to dynamically store a list of to-do tasks and tick them off as you go along. The current iteration takes your input and stores the data as an object, which is then appended into the list. The data is converted to JSON and stored in Local Storage, so you can save your tasks upon leaving the page.

# Features
- Dynamic todo creation
- Grey out completed tasks
- Edit existing entries by double clicking a task and pressing Enter to update
- Delete tasks once you are finished with them

# Things I would like to add
- I would like to integrate a back end using Node.js and MongoDB and store tasks by implementing authentication and saving tasks in a unique collection based on the user
- Add routes to implement additional pages in the project, then append links dynamically to a hamburger menu
- Implement more features such as a "Delete All" button

# What I have learned
Building this project helped me to understand the fundamentals of building with React including using components to build a dynamic site using both class-based constructors and lifecycle states and also function-based React Hooks. I will keep adding to this knowledge as I continue to build more applications using the MERN stack and find new and innovative ways to create fast, functional and accessible projects in my portfolio.
